# Idea For Apairo

## Persist a synchronize() result as a reloadable synchronous view

`.synchronize()` recomputes the matching every session, and nothing lets us
freeze the result and reload the aligned data as a synchronous dataset without
recopying anything.

The insight: a synchronization, reduced to its state, is not data — it's an
index matrix. For each reference frame `i`, each async channel points to a source
row `j` (plus a validity mask for frames with no match within tolerance).
`N_ref × N_channels` integers. This is exactly `filter` generalised: `filter`
persists *one* index array (`np.save(view.indices)`, reload without I/O);
synchronize persisted is *one index column per channel*.

So "register a sync view inside an async dataset" ≠ multiplying datasets. It
means writing that mapping into `.apairo` and reloading it as a synchronous
dataset (`RawDataset`-clean ergonomics) without ever copying a point cloud.

Proposed surface:

```python
sync = ds.synchronize(reference="lidar", method="nearest", tolerance=0.05)
sync.persist("lidar_synced")                       # once
ds2 = apairo.RawDataset(root).load_view("lidar_synced")   # behaves synchronous
```

Persisted state = index matrix `N_ref × N_channels` + validity mask +
`{reference, method, tolerance}` + fingerprint of the source channels.

Open design questions, by priority:
- **Provenance / staleness.** Frozen indices go stale if a source channel
  changes. `filter` already has this; here it's sharper because the mapping also
  encodes the method. The view must carry params + a source-channel
  hash/timestamp so apairo can say "stale → recompute". Otherwise we silently
  reintroduce the `trav_traj` bug (length 19398 ≠ 9701).
- **Addressing.** `channels.yaml` registers channels; need a parallel registry
  of named views in `.apairo` (e.g. `views.yaml`).
- **Reload semantics.** Reloaded view presents as synchronous (single index,
  aligned frames) but keeps the reference timestamp accessible.

Placement: apairo core — view + persistence mechanism in `.apairo`, in the
direct lineage of `filter`/`synchronize`. No satellite covers view persistence.
